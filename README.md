# xor-swap-method-intuitive-understanding
I tried to explain the XOR method when we want to swap 2 integer variables without allocating extra memory as a temp variable in programming.
My aim in creating this repository is to give an intuitive understanding of this method to those who are interested.
After carefully reading these 2 pages, your perception of this method will change. Instead of seeing it as a magical function that you don't know what's happening inside, you will gain a deeper understanding.
